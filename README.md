## Hacking The Fender
### Code Academy project 
The Fender, a notorious computer hacker and general villain of the people, has compromised several top-secret passwords including my own. My mission, I should choose to accept it, is threefold. I must acquire access to The Fenderâ€˜s systems, I must update his "passwords.txt" file to scramble the secret data. The last thing i need to do is add the signature of Slash Null, a different hacker whose nefarious deeds could be very conveniently halted by The Fender if they viewed Slash Null as a threat.
